# lancache-docker

First attempt at building a docker-compose file for all reqs for pihole>lancache
I think it's working...

# TODO

- [ ] remove pihole password
- [ ] come up with sensible host locations for cache etc and update volumes
- [ ] make a .env file for all the variables
- [ ] make a script that edits the .env file based on perams gleaned from the host
